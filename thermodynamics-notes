definition:
	The branch of science that deals with conversion, transformation, management, of different forms of energies especially heat and work
	
primitive concept:-- 
	A concept or term taken from another branch of science in thermodynamics, Eg volume, pressure, velocity, force, mass etc

non-primitive concept:-- 
	A concept or term that is fully originated and defined in thermodynamics , only 2:-- TEMPERATURE and ENTROPY

premise:-- 
	A concept or a term that cannot be proved but only be validated through observation and experimentation, we assume them to be true
	universally (postulates, axioms), {HEAT and WORK}
	
operational definitions:--
	Procedure or Sequence of operations or Set of rules to be followed to define an entity and how to measure it is called an operational
	definition.


Thermodynamic System:-
	A specific volume of space (universe) with well defined boundaries, which is under consideration for the study of thermodynamics 
	(something that is of our interest and is our reference point)
	
	- isolated
		boundary facilitates neither mass nor energy interactions
		
	- closed
		boundary facilitates energy interaction but not mass interaction 
		
	- open 
		boundary facilitates both mass and energy interactions
	
	--> being isolated/ close/ open, these are the 'properties' of the system undergoing a process
	
	- simple
		Number of two way mode of work in system = 1
		
	- complex
		Number of two way mode of work in system > 1
		
	- rudimentary
		Number of two way mode of work in system = 0
		
	
Thermodynamic Boundary:-
	A surface that separates the (system and surrounding) or (system and system), and facilitates thermodynamic interactions through it,is
	called thermodynamic boundary, The energy transfer takes place through boundaries only
	
	- real (you can touch,show) / imaginary
	- fixed / movable
	- well defined but non-physical
	
	
	
Thermodynamic Surrounding:-
	Anything and everything outside the system, which gets influenced by the changes that take place in the system is called surrounding
	


Thermodynamic Universe:-
	The combination of all systems, boundaries, surroundings is called universe




Thermodynamic State:-
	The specific situation in which the system exists at the specific time,which is well defined by finite thermodynamic properties is called 		
	thermodynamic state
	
	- operational definition
	1. make list of all relevant characteristics
	2. scratch irrelevant characteristics
	3. quantify each relevant characteristics (typically by measurement)
	
 	- equilibrium / non-equilibrium


Point of view:-
	Microscopic / Macroscopic (we learn macroscopic thermodynamics known as 'classical approach')
	1. System is assumed to be continuous or 'continuum'
	2. no quantum effects
	3. scale independent
	4. less variable count
	5. ease of handling
	
	--> In this approach or point of view, Laws are derived by generalizing our understanding of natural phenomenon. 
	    Therefore, it is also known as Phenomenological Thermodynamics.


Thermodynamic property:-
	A relevant characteristic used to describe the state of a thermodynamic system, is known as thermodynamic property.
	
	- primitive --> adopted from other branches of science
	- non-primitive/basic --> originated and defined in thermodynamics only 2 temperature and entropy
	- derived --> combination of primitive and non-primitive
	- intensive --> any property {primitive/basic} that is independent of the mass of the system, Eg temperature, pressure etc
	- extensive --> any property {primitive/basic} that is dependent on the mass of the system, Eg volume, enthalpy, entropy etc
	- specific --> any property {primitive/basic} per unit mass {divide the property by mass of system}, all specific properties are intensive


Thermodynamic state space:-
	The graphical (Cartesian co-ordinate) representation of thermodynamic state of the system with, each property on one axis respectively, 
	is called as thermodynamic state space (TSS)
	
	1. a thermodynamic state is a 'point' on the co-ordinate system (TSS)
	2. a point on TSS represents a state of system at a specific time
	3. in TSS each axis represents one relevant characteristics (TSS can be 'n' dimensional, with 'n' relevant characteristics)
	4. a unique point on TSS is a thermodynamically equilibrium state (ie they are 'representable' on TSS, has unique set of values)
	5. we can only draw a point on TSS if its in equilibrium, other wise not.
	6. a non representable point on TSS is a thermodynamically non-equilibrium state (ie they are 'non representable' on TSS, cloudy)
	
	
Thermodynamic equilibrium:-
	When a system is in mechanical, chemical and thermal equilibrium it is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium
	

State postulate 1 :-
	Number of properties required to uniquely define a state of the system {how would we know ?} 
	- (it is possible to define a state of system uniquely only using primitive and/or non-primitive)


Thermodynamic process:-
	The change of state is called process
	
	--> to define process, we must know system / initial state of the system / final state of the system
	--> as we 'know' initial and final states, they are well defined {in equilibrium} and therefore we can draw them on TSS as a point 

	- quasi-static
		1. when intermediate states between initial and final state are also in equilibrium, it is called quasi-static process
		2. we can join initial and final states with continuous line/locus as each state is well defined {is in equilibrium}
		
	- non-quasi-static
		1. when intermediate states between initial and final state are not in equilibrium, it is called as non-quasi-static process
		2. we can not join initial and final states with continuous line/locus as each state is not well defined {is in non-equilibrium}
		
	- reversible
		- a process in which the system and surroundings can be returned to the original conditions from the final state without producing
		  any changes in the thermodynamics properties of the universe
		
	- irreversible
		- a process which is not reversible
		
	- isothermal
		- a process in which temperature remains constant
		
	- isochoric
		- a process in which volume remains constant
		
	- isobaric
		- a process in which pressure remains constant
		
	- isentropic
		- a process in which entropy remains constant
		
	- adiabatic
		- a process in which heat remains constant
		- a process with pure work interaction {heat interaction is zero}
		
	- polytropic
		- a process where nothing remains constant (temperature, pressure, volume, entropy) , chaotic.


Thermodynamic Cycle :-
	If in a process, the initial and final states are coincident point on TSS (ie they are equal), the such processes are called cycle.
	
	- quasi-static
	- non-quasi-static
	- reversible 
	- irreversible
	- ideal
	- real
	- power generating
	- power consuming
	- carnot / otto / diesel / dual combustion
	- rankine / sterling / atkinson
	- vapor compression / vapor absorption
	
	
	
Thermodynamic interactions :-
	Energy {only HEAT and WORK} in transition (flow) between 2 or more systems {one system can be surrounding to other system}
	
	- interaction causes the change of state (lies at heart of thermodynamics)
	
	- work interaction (pure work)
		1. it is primitive
		2. useful to classify the systems
		3. accepts the possibility of existence of impure work (heat {non-work} or heat + work)
		
		--> general form of the work -->  dW = +- XdY   {mechanical, electrical, chemical, thermal}
		
		i. ( X --> property and Y --> property )  --> Two way mode of work (work can take place in both the direction)
			If both X and Y are properties the X is compulsory Intensive and Y is compulsory Extensive property
			
		ii. any one is not a property then --> One way mode of work (work can take place in only one direction)
		
		- modes of work is general characteristics of all the work interactions
		
	----> WORK INTERACTION HAS 'SIGN CONVENTION' :
		--> work done by the system is positive (+)
		--> work done on the system is negative (-)
		--> the sign decides the 'direction' of the work with respect to 'system'
		
	----> Operational definition of work :-)
		
		*( we have interaction 'I' from system A to system B ) [ A --(I)--> B ]
		
		1. Try to setup system C (by replacing system B), such that all it does while executing in the cycle, that it raises a mass 'm'
		   through a height of 'h' in gravitational field 'g' , and doesn't do anything else.
		   if system C can be setup, the 'I' is the work interaction (pure), and work is done from A to B(C) [A --(I)--> B]
		   work(A-->B) = +mgh (quantification)
		   work(B-->A) = -work(A-->B) = -mgh 
		
		2. If in step 1, system C could not be tested up by replacing the system B, then now try replacing the system A in step 2
		   if system C can be setup, the 'I' is the work interaction (pure), and work is done from B to A(C) [B --(I)--> A]
		   work(B-->A) = +mgh (quantification)
		   work(A-->B) = -work(B-->A) = -mgh  
		
		3. If we cannot setup a system C either by replacing system A or system B, then interaction 'I' is not pure work.
		   - it can be pure heat (non-work)
		   - it can be (heat + work)
		   
		
	----> conclusion:-
		1. Two (or more) systems must be involved in the interaction
		2. Work(A-->B) = -Work(B-->A) , they are 100% equal in 'magnitude'
		3. work doesn't happens 'on its own', some conscious efforts are needed for thermodynamic work to happen
		4. There must be a 'recipient' system or arrangement to receive the work (free expansion means no work)
		5. eg. free fall of projectile:
			a. in mechanics, work = mgh, PE = exist, KE = exist
			b. in thermodynamics, work = 0, PE = exist, KE = exist, because there is no recipient system. 
		
		
	----> Evaluation of Work:-
		1. A system can involve different types of work simultaneously
		2. To find total work we SUM all the works from all different modes
			- this statement give rise to this differential equation:
				dW = dW(expand) + dW(electric) + dW(stirring) + dW(magnetic) + dW(electromagnetic) + .....   ----Over the process;
			
			- the integration of above equation is possible for QUASI-STATIC process only
			
	----> Significance of two way mode of work:-
		- a system may have 'N' possible modes of work
		- let 'N2w'be number of two way mode of work in a system
		
		then if N2w = 1 : system is called Simple system (gas in piston cylinder arrangement)
			N2w > 1 : system is called Complex system (bubble, water droplet)
			N2w = 0 : system is called Rudimentary system (thermometer)
		
		--> simple and complex systems can be constrained to become rudimentary system	
				
		


						      ~~~~~ LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS ~~~~~
						 
	
	
Some understanding:-	
	- these are laws of nature
	- these laws demonstrate the universal truth
	- there are no proofs and no derivations for these laws, we believe in them, as there are no evidence of violation or contradiction
	- these laws are restricted to Classical {Macro} thermodynamics only and are NOT applicable to Statistical {Micro} thermodynamics


2 Approaches to laws of thermodynamics:-
	
	1. Keenan's approach
		- he proposed "Law of stable equilibrium". {its a premise}	
		- statement-> "Any Thermodynamic System, completely isolated from its surrounding tends to be in a Thermodynamic equilibrium state"
		- attempt to merge all laws of thermodynamics into 1 law
	
	2. Caratheodory's approach
		- statement -> "Our understanding of behavior of nature"
		- according to him
			- 1st law : "our understanding of behavior of ADIABATIC system"
			- 0th law : "our understanding of behavior of NON-ADIABATIC system"
			- 2nd law : "our understanding of behavior of ENGINES" {w.r.t mechanical engineering}
	
	
	
adiabatic:-
	- work transfer only
	- a adjective that transformers the system, boundary and a process in a such a way that :
		system : a system constrained in such a way that only work transfer is allowed
		boundary : facilitates work interaction only
		process : a process in which only work interaction is possible
		

Joules law:-
	- work done in an adiabatic process from initial state 1 to final state 2 is INDEPENDENT from any path taken to reach the final state and
	  any other details of the process.
	- thus knowing the system, state 1, state 2, and process is adiabatic 1 --> 2 is enough {no other details are required}
	 
	- work{adiabatic} is a point function	
	
	
	
point function:-
	1. depends on start and end state only {path has no meaning}
	2. knowing system , start point, end point only is necesarry
	3. it is an exact diffrential so integration is possible
	4. it is either primitive / basic property (eg P, V, T, S etc)
	5. cyclic integration of point function is always ZERO (= 0)
	

path function:-
	1. it depends on start , end points as well as path taken {path is meaningful}
	2. knowing system , start point, end point and path taken is necesarry
	3. it is an in-exact differential so integration is not possible
	4. it is neither primitive nor basic , it is a definition (heat and work)
	5. cyclic integration of path function is non-zero (!= 0)
	
	
	---> Wad (work{adiabatic}) has no absolute value
	---> Wad(1 --> 2) has a unique value
		- ie Wad has a unique value only over a process , it always requires a reference
		
	

Thermodyanamic energy (E) :-
	- it is 'defined' as, negative of the adiabatic work done
	--> E2 - E1 = - (W{ad} 1 --> 2)
	- neagtive sign is for maintaining the consistency in sign convention system w.r.t 'thermodynamic system'
		- eg of 'working on trade-mill'
		- if system does work (work is positive),but its energy 'goes down',so change in energy is negative because (E2 < E1, (E2-E1) < 0)
		  and according to formula, -(+ quantitiy) = -(quantity), therfore its consistence 
		- if work is done on the system (work is negative),but its energy 'goes up', so change in energy is positive 
		  because (E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) > 0) and according to formula, -(- quantitiy) = +(quantity), therfore its consistence 
	
	
Heat (Q):-
	--> heat = general work - adiabatic work ( Q{1-->2} = W{1-->2} - W{ad}{1-->2})
	- how did we arrived here ?
		- lets take a system, start point 1 and end point 2
		- lets take 2 paths {no detail given}, first is adibatic and second is general {no detail given, may or may not be adiabatic}
		- then we definitly know that, work done in above 2 process is not equal
		- so if works's are not equal then there should be some difference {positive / negative / zero dont care}
		- and 'this difference' is defined as 'change in heat' in process 1 to 2.
		
		
		
first law of thermodynamics (1st law):-
	--> Q{1-->2} = W{1-->2} + E{1-->2}           ... [ heat = work + energy ---> over process 1 to 2]
		- based on,
			--> Q{1-->2} = W{1-->2} - W{ab}{1-->2} ...(by defination of heat)
			--> E{1-->2} = - W{ab}{1-->2}	...(by defination of energy)
			
	--> Q and W are path function { not the property of the system }
	--> E is point function { property of the system } (its 0 when it is a cyclic process)


State postulate 2:-
	-- if we have a system of fixed mass, then number of independent intensive variables required to define uniquely the state of the system is
	    = N2w + 1 { N2w is number of 2 way mode of work in the system } { all N2w+1 are intensive }
	    
	   -- simple system : 2 (1 + 1) intensive properties are sufficient to define the system uniquely.
	   -- complwx system : more than 2 (> 1 + 1) intensive properties are required to define the system uniquely.
	   -- rudimentary system : 1 (0 + 1) intensive properties is sufficient to define the system uniquely. 
	
	
			
limitations of 1st law:-
	
	1. 1st Law doesn’t answer that, “Is it ALWAYS possible to take a system from its state 1 to state 2 by an adiabatic process ONLY”.
	2. 1st Law doesn’t talk about the details of non-work interactions. It only accepts the possibility of non-work interactions.
	3. 1st Law tells us only about the Quantity and doesn’t talk about the Quality.
	4. 1st Law doesn’t dictate the direction of interaction, it only tells us that system undergoes some interaction.
	5. 1st Law fails to tell us about the feasibility of the interaction or the limiting range of feasible interaction
	
	
	
	
	
	
zeroth law (0th law):-
